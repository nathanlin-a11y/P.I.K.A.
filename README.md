# P.I.K.A.: Advanced AI Workflow and Cognitive Engine

P.I.K.A. is a flexible framework built for intelligent task execution and conversational workflows. It empowers users to create, manage, and deploy AI agents seamlessly by leveraging a microservices architecture and MongoDB for robust data storage.

> **What's New in v0.3**:
>
> - **RAG**: Introduced Retrieval Tasks for prompt-based searches in Data Clusters, returning the most relevant chunks. Supports embedding entire Data Clusters as well.
> - **HITL**: Human-in-the-loop (HITL) functionality allows you to insert User Checkpoints to pause tasks or chats at specific nodes for user intervention.
> - **COT**: Chain-of-Thought (COT) implementation uses `[analysis]` tags in prompts to enhance agentsâ€™ reasoning capabilities.
> - **DOCUMENTS**: Agents now parse `[pikaDocument]` tags to better structure their responses.
> - **NODE FLOW**: Fully implemented node execution logic for tasks, simplifying workflows into clear, interconnected nodes.
> - **FLOW VIEWER**: Task UI now provides detailed views of task logic and execution flow.
> - **PROMPT PARSER**: Dynamically visualize templated prompts to understand how agents process input.
> - **APIs**: Added integrations for Wolfram Alpha, Google Knowledge Graph, PixArt Image Generation (local), and Bark TTS (local). Local embedding support included.
> - **DATA CLUSTERS**: Chats and tasks now support updatable Data Clusters to store embeddable items like messages, files, or task outputs. Retrieval Tasks utilize these clusters for contextual data.
> - **TEXT MANAGEMENT**: Two new text-splitting methods (recursive and semantic) improve embeddings and RAG workflows. A Message Pruner helps manage context size in LLMs.
> - **REDIS QUEUE**: Added a Redis-based queuing system to support concurrent task execution in workflows.

> **Note**: Updating to v0.3 requires reinitializing your database. Navigate to `User Settings > Danger Zone` to reinitialize. As P.I.K.A. is in Alpha, frequent updates and changes should be expected.

## Version Updates

### **v0.3.5**

- **Backend**:
  - Updated LM Studio manager (requires build `0.3.5 9-H` to match SDK changes).
  - Optimized routes with `populated` endpoints to reduce frontend memory usage.
- **Frontend**:
  - Improved memory handling for large datasets.
  - Added Context % estimation in the chat interface.
  - Implemented API validation checks for tasks and chats.
  - Enhanced item menus with functions for download, copy, duplicate, delete, and edit.
- **Workflow Module**:
  - Refined backend communication and improved task execution logic.

### **v0.3.10 & v0.3.11**

- **Encryption**: References are now encrypted; database restart required for updates.
- **Threads**: Chats now support multiple threads, allowing separate conversations within a single chat. Threads can also be shared between chats for cross-agent collaboration.
- **Admin Role**: Added admin capabilities for managing users and API keys.

## Planned Features for v0.4

- **Computer-based agents** for automating system-level tasks.
- **Communication APIs**, including Gmail and potential messaging integrations.
- **Recurring Tasks** to enable periodic workflow execution and data aggregation.
- **CUDA Support** to run local models in workflows more efficiently.
- **Context Management** with LLMs to summarize and deduplicate long messages.

## Project Architecture

P.I.K.A. is built with three primary components:

1. **Backend (Node.js with TypeScript)**:
   - Handles database interactions (MongoDB), file system management, and integrations like LM Studio.
2. **Workflow Module (Python with Pydantic)**:
   - Manages task logic, API interactions, and execution workflows. It communicates with the backend and database.
3. **Frontend (React with TypeScript)**:
   - Provides the user interface for managing workflows, visualizing tasks, and interacting with agents.

## Goals

1. Deliver a platform for creating, testing, and deploying agent-driven workflows.
2. Provide a text-based framework where human language is the primary input and output.
3. Support a model-agnostic architecture, allowing users to integrate preferred AI models.
4. Offer an open-source framework that ensures full user control over workflows and data.

## Setup and Installation

1. Ensure **Git** and [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) are installed. On Windows, Docker Compose is included by default. Verify its presence with [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72928891/how-can-i-check-if-docker-compose-plugin-is-installed). For Linux, follow [these steps](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).
2. *(Optional)* Install [**LM Studio**](https://lmstudio.ai/) for local model support. Using an incompatible version may result in errors. Recommended build: `0.3.5 9-H`.
3. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourRepo/pika.git
4. Create an .env file in the root directory using template.env as a reference. Fill in API keys (e.g., OpenAI) as needed.
5. Run the appropriate script for your operating system:
Windows: Run run.bat

Linux/Mac: Run run.sh Alternatively, execute the script directly:
python run.py

Framework Overview
P.I.K.A. revolves around four key components:

1. APIs: Integrate with external services for data and processing.
2. Agents: Use models and prompts to process input and generate output.
3. Tasks: Combine agents, APIs, and other tasks to perform specific actions.
4. Chats: Provide conversational interfaces powered by tasks and agents.

## Task Execution

Tasks consist of interconnected "nodes" that define execution logic. Each task starts with a designated start_node and follows the routing defined in node_end_code_routing.

Task Types
API Tasks: Interact with external services such as Google Search or Wikipedia.
Prompt Agent Tasks: Use prompts and LLMs for advanced logic execution, including:
Code Execution: Executes code blocks in Docker containers.
Code Generation: Ensures output includes required code blocks.
Workflows: Chains multiple tasks to form complex processes.
