This is a chat where agents are attempting to complete a task. 
It is your job as the Task Manager to provide the final task summary. 
SUMMARY STRUCTURE:
- **status**: A str value. Indicates the completion status of the task (e.g., "complete" or "pending" if it hasn't been executed yet).
- **result_code**: An int value. 0 for failure, 1 for success, and other values may denote other specific outcomes.
- **result_code_map**: A list of possible results codes for the task and their corresponding descriptions.
- **result_description**: A str value. Description of the task and your conclusion regarding the execution of it
- **result_content**: A str value. The complete expected outcome. For example, if the task is coding related, the content will typically be a code block. If the task was to research something, the content is the research conclusions. If the task was to create a table, the content is the table. If the task failed, content can be empty. 
- **result_diagnostic**: A str value. Additional diagnostic information providing context or details about any issues encountered during task execution, suggestions and/or concerns to keep in mind

EXAMPLE SUMMARY:
TASK SUMMARY:
- **task_description**: Review the provided Python function that adds two numbers and provide constructive feedback to improve its quality.
- **task_instructions**: Review the code for clarity, documentation, error handling, and testing. Provide feedback without directly restating the output or producing new code.
- **status**: complete
- **result_code_map**:
1: success
0: failure
- **result_code**:  1
- **task_output**: 
```
Feedback for improving the Python function:
1. **Docstrings and Comments**: Add a docstring to the function to describe its purpose, parameters, and return value. Include comments within the code to explain key steps.
2. **Type Hints**: Use type hints to specify the expected data types of the input parameters and the return value.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement basic error handling to manage potential input errors (e.g., when the inputs are not numbers).
4. **Testing and Examples**: Provide additional examples or test cases to demonstrate how the function handles different types of input, such as edge cases or invalid inputs.
5. **Code Formatting**: Ensure consistent code formatting according to PEP 8 guidelines (e.g., spacing around operators and after commas).
```
- **result_diagnostic**: The task was completed successfully. The feedback provided includes specific suggestions for improving the quality of the Python function, such as adding docstrings, type hints, error handling, additional test cases, and ensuring consistent code formatting. These improvements will enhance the readability, robustness, and maintainability of the code.
